# Poiem

**A little tracking. A lot of living.**

The active web application and Expo companion are now **Poiem**, with **poiem.app** as the chosen brand domain. Momo remains the mascot.

- Web application: `web/app` — run `npm run dev` from the repository root.
- Local brand kit: [localhost:5173/brand/index.html](http://localhost:5173/brand/index.html).
- [Brand guide and domain launch checklist](design/branding/poiem/brand-guide.md).
- [Logo and icon exports](web/app/public/brand).

This rebrand preserves account, package, and storage identifiers. Connecting the new domain, OAuth branding, email sender verification, and store releases are separate launch steps. The original Swift/Kotlin apps and their historical documentation below remain upstream reference material, not Poiem release claims.

Open-source, privacy-first calorie tracker for iOS and Android. After sign-up, the web app uses Poiem’s OpenRouter key and `google/gemma-4-31b-it`; anyone can instead add their own API key in You → AI setup. Mobile remains BYOK-only. Snap a meal, share a food photo into Fud AI, scan a barcode, combine two camera shots, add a note to a camera or library photo, ask your AI coach how to hit your goal, speak your lunch, or use Siri Shortcuts on iOS to log food and weight.

iOS 4.4 build 25 makes goal calculation AI-powered — Recalculate Goals and onboarding compute your calories and macros via AI, refined from your logged intake and weight trend with a formula fallback — and merges Energy Burn Goals into a single Apple Health–aware Adaptive Goals toggle. It also adds goal locks, optional body-circumference measurements that feed Recalculate and the Coach, swipe-between-days on Home, formatted (markdown) Coach replies, dual-labelled weight goals (Cutting / Recomp / Bulking), new-version notifications, and 12/24-hour log times.

Android 2.3.0 build 26 brings the same AI-driven goals, goal locks, body measurements, and onboarding AI setup, plus an in-camera flash toggle, Health Connect now reading your weight and body fat (read-only is enough to sync), a new "Fud AI Today" all-in-one widget, fixes for widgets stuck loading, and a feet/inches height fix.

## Features

### Logging
- **Snap food** — camera identifies meals and estimates nutrition
- **Camera + Note** — add a description with the photo for better accuracy
- **Camera + Camera** — capture two images for one analysis, useful for front/back packaging or food + label combos
- **iOS Share Extension** — send a food photo from Photos or another app directly into Fud AI for review and logging
- **Nutrition label scan** — reads packaging for precise per-serving data
- **Barcode lookup** — scan packaged foods on iOS and Android and fill nutrition from Open Food Facts when product data is available
- **Photo library** — analyze existing photos
- **Photo library + Note** — pick an existing photo and add context before AI analysis
- **Text input** — type food descriptions
- **Voice input** — speak your meals hands-free (6 STT options with per-provider language selection, see below)
- **iOS Siri Shortcuts** — say phrases like "Log food in Fud AI", "Calories today in Fud AI", or "Log my weight in Fud AI"; the phrase guide lives in Settings → Siri Phrases
- **Manual Entry** — log known calories and macros without AI
- **Smart serving units** — AI can show slices, pieces, cups, ml, or other visible serving units while grams stay the source of truth
- **Review nutrition unlock** — correct calories, macros, and detailed nutrients before logging, then lock again so serving changes scale from your edits
- **Meal What if?** — preview how a reviewed meal changes today's calories and macros, then ask AI for a practical suggestion before logging
- **Saved Meals** — Recents, Frequent, and Favorites with safer swipe actions, search, and drag-to-reorder

### Intelligence
- **AI Coach tab** — multi-turn chat with memory. Coach sees your profile, weight history, food log, today's date/timezone, and richer meal details, then answers questions like "what's my expected weight in 30 days?" or "how do I lose 2 kg?". Coach also supports camera/photo attachments on Android. Memory persists across launches; Reset button starts a fresh conversation. Long-press any reply to copy.
- **AI Access** — After sign-up, Poiem web uses the operator OpenRouter key and `google/gemma-4-31b-it`. Bring Your Own Key is an optional toggle in You → AI setup; native clients remain BYOK-only.
- **Apple Intelligence fallback** — on supported iPhones, food-description analysis for text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food logs can use Apple Intelligence on-device as the final fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail.
- **AI optional nutrient goals** — estimate detailed nutrient goals from profile data without changing calorie/protein/carbs/fat formulas.
- **Goal-aware prompt chips** — suggested questions change based on whether your goal is Lose / Gain / Maintain
- **Thermodynamic weight forecast** — expected weight at 30/60/90 days, predicted vs observed weekly change, days-to-goal, under-logging detection. Surfaced through Coach as live context on every turn.
- **Resilient requests** — transient provider overloads (503 / 529 / 429) auto-retry with 1s / 2s / 4s exponential backoff across both food analysis and Coach chat, so short spikes resolve invisibly

### Tracking
- **Expanded nutrients** per entry — macros plus sugar, fiber, fats, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamins, folate, omega-3, and more when available
- **Custom Home nutrient cards** — swap the top cards from protein/carbs/fat to fiber, sodium, vitamin D, calcium, or other tracked nutrients
- **Optional nutrient goals** — set or AI-estimate goals for the non-macro nutrients; these stay separate from the calorie and macro calculator
- **Scrollable week calendar** — swipe to any past week, configurable start day
- **Food log sorting** — keep the default grouped view, or sort meal sections by latest logging order from the Home screen
- **Progress charts** — weight trends, calorie history, macro averages (1W to All Time)
- **Progress summaries** — weight and body-fat ranges show average and net change for the selected week, month, or longer window
- **Decimal nutrition totals** — macros and detailed nutrients preserve decimal precision in logs, Home, widgets, and View More
- **Weight History** — tap-to-delete past entries, syncs deletion to Apple Health
- **Goal tracking** — set target weight, BMR/TDEE auto-calculation; goal-reached alert fires from both manual logs and Apple Health reads
- **Adaptive Goals (Experimental)** — optional weekly calorie correction from observed weight trend; pinned macros stay pinned and unlocked macros auto-balance

### Health & platform
- **Apple Health** — bidirectional sync for body measurements + nutrition types written per meal; Siri food/weight logs write through the same HealthKit paths, and Experimental Energy Burn Goals can estimate calorie targets from active/total energy while macros stay editable
- **Health Connect** — Android sync for nutrition, weight, and body fat, with permission reconciliation and backfill support; Experimental Energy Burn Goals can use recent energy data for calorie targets
- **Apple Watch** — watchOS app and complications show calories and macros at a glance
- **Widgets** — iOS Home Screen has Fud AI in Small, Medium, and Large plus a small-only Fud AI Protein widget; Lock Screen widgets stay separate, and Android Glance widgets (including a new "Fud AI Today" all-in-one calories + macros widget) update when you log
- **Android 2.3.0 update** — AI-driven goals, goal locks, optional body measurements, and onboarding AI setup; an in-camera flash toggle; Health Connect now reads weight + body fat (read-only is enough to sync); a new "Fud AI Today" widget; fixes for widgets stuck loading; and a feet/inches height fix
- **Share the App** — native iOS share sheet from About → forwards App Store URL plus a personalized message and `fud-ai.app` link; message body localized into all 16 iOS languages
- **Update check** — About shows the installed app version, opens the App Store / Play Store when a newer version is available, and shows a tab dot for pending updates
- **Theme color** — iOS and Android Settings let users change the app accent, with matching home screen / launcher icons
- **Languages** — iOS supports 16 languages: Arabic, Azerbaijani, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish. Android supports the same set except Polish. The app auto-selects by the phone's Language setting; iOS 4.4 build 25 localizes the new Adaptive Goals description across all 15 non-English locales.
- **Meal reminders** — customizable breakfast, lunch, dinner notifications
- **Dark mode** — system, light, or dark
- **Metric & imperial** units

## AI Providers

On the web, signed-in accounts use Poiem’s OpenRouter key and `google/gemma-4-31b-it` (Free: 20 food scans/day; Premium: 100 food scans and 50 Coach messages/day). Your own API key is optional in You → AI setup and is sent from the browser to the provider you pick. Free Gemini keys are available at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). For text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food descriptions on supported iPhones, Apple Intelligence can run on-device only as the last fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and apply the plans migration to turn Poiem AI on; see `docs/operations/managed-ai-rollout.md`.

| Provider | Format | Highlight | Needs API Key |
|----------|--------|-----------|:---:|
| Google Gemini | Gemini API | Gemini 3.5 Flash / 2.5 Pro / Flash | Yes |
| OpenAI | OpenAI | GPT-5 / 4o | Yes |
| Anthropic Claude | Messages API | Sonnet 4.6 (default) / Opus 4.7 / Haiku 4.5 | Yes |
| xAI Grok | OpenAI-compatible | Grok 4 | Yes |
| OpenRouter | OpenAI-compatible | Any model, free-form IDs | Yes |
| Together AI | OpenAI-compatible | Llama 4, Qwen VL | Yes |
| Groq | OpenAI-compatible | Llama 4 Scout, very fast | Yes |
| Hugging Face | OpenAI-compatible | Gemma 3, Qwen VL, Llama Vision (open-weight router, free-form IDs) | Yes |
| Fireworks AI | OpenAI-compatible | Qwen VL, Llama Vision, Phi-3 Vision | Yes |
| DeepInfra | OpenAI-compatible | Gemma 3, Llama Vision, Qwen VL | Yes |
| Mistral | OpenAI-compatible | Pixtral Large / 12B (open-weight) | Yes |
| Ollama | OpenAI-compatible (local) | Llama 3.2 Vision, LLaVA, Moondream — runs on your Mac | No |
| Custom (OpenAI-compatible) | OpenAI-compatible | You set base URL + free-form model name | Optional |

## Speech-to-Text Providers

Pick how voice input is transcribed. Native iOS / Android is the default — free, on-device where supported, real-time. On Android, native speech first tries the on-device language path, then falls back to Android recognition with network/provider defaults if the phone lacks offline support for that language. Each provider has its own language setting: use Provider Auto, Use Device Language, or an explicit language hint where supported.

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Native iOS / Android (On-Device) | Free, offline where the phone supports the selected language, real-time partial results |
| Gemini Audio | Batch audio transcription through Gemini for BYOK users |
| OpenAI Whisper | Whisper-1 via `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Groq (Whisper) | Whisper-large-v3, very fast, has a free tier |
| Deepgram | Nova-3, fast and accurate |
| AssemblyAI | Universal model, strong accuracy, free tier |

For Android phones where native speech is inconsistent, Groq (Whisper) or Deepgram are recommended alternatives; the developer currently uses Groq.

API keys are stored encrypted on-device: **iOS Keychain** on iOS and **EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by Android Keystore** on Android.

For the Coach chat, every turn builds a slim system prompt from your live profile, BMR formula in use, computed forecast, today's date/timezone, and a one-line snapshot of available data. Coach then pulls any date range of weight, body fat, calorie totals, or food entries on demand via tool calling — ask "what was my weight in March?" or "show me my body fat trend over the last 6 months" and it fetches exactly the slice it needs, including meal source, meal type, serving size, and micronutrients.

## Calorie & Macro Calculation

The app calculates personalized daily targets using established nutrition science formulas:

| Step | Formula | Details |
|------|---------|---------|
| **BMR** | Katch-McArdle | `370 + 21.6 × lean mass (kg)` — used when body fat % is known |
| **BMR** | Mifflin-St Jeor | `10w + 6.25h − 5a ± 5` — fallback when body fat is unknown |
| **TDEE** | BMR × activity | Multiplier ranges from 1.2 (sedentary) to 2.0 (extra active) |
| **Daily Calories** | TDEE + adjustment | Adjustment = `weeklyChangeKg × 7700 / 7` (deficit or surplus) |
| **Protein** | Activity + goal | `0.8 – 2.2 g/kg` body weight by activity, plus +0.2 g/kg during cutting phase (Helms et al 2014); when body fat % is known, Activity Level also shows the equivalent g/kg lean-mass multiplier |
| **Fat** | Fixed ratio | `0.6 g/kg` body weight |
| **Carbs** | Auto-balanced | Remainder from calories − protein − fat (any macro can be pinned; max 2 pinned) |

All values can be manually overridden in Settings, with a **Recalculate Goals** button to snap back to formula defaults.

## Architecture

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Language** | Swift 5, SwiftUI, iOS 17.6+ |
| **Storage** | UserDefaults (local JSON), Keychain (API keys) |
| **AI** | `GeminiService` for food + label analysis, `ChatService` for multi-turn Coach chat, both route across all 13 providers |
| **Speech** | Native `SFSpeechRecognizer` / Android `SpeechRecognizer` or remote providers via `SpeechService` (m4a upload) |
| **Health** | HealthKit / Health Connect read-write paths for body measurements and meal nutrition, with UUID-tagged samples for safe delete |
| **Pattern** | `@Observable` + `.environment()`, main actor isolation |
| **Localization** | `Localizable.xcstrings` (String Catalog), 16 iOS languages, auto-selected by iPhone's system language |
| **Dependencies** | Native platform frameworks; app data and API keys remain local |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/apoorvdarshan/fud-ai.git
cd fud-ai
```

### iOS

```bash
xcodebuild -project ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj \
  -scheme calorietracker \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

Open `ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select your device, and run.

### Android

Open `android/` in Android Studio (Narwhal or newer), let Gradle sync, hit ▶ Run. Or from the CLI:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker/.MainActivity
```

First launch walks you through onboarding (gender, birthday, height/weight with metric/imperial toggle, body fat %, activity with protein target preview, goal, goal speed, notifications, Apple Health / Health Connect, and review). After sign-up, web users use Poiem AI; add your own key in **You → AI setup** if you want a different provider or model. A free Gemini key is available at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. Bug reports and feature requests welcome.

Adding a new translation? Open `ios/calorietracker/Localizable.xcstrings` in Xcode and fill in your language column — everything else is already wired.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/apoorvdarshan/fud-ai/security/advisories/new) for sensitive issues.

## Privacy

No accounts, no cloud sync, no analytics. BYOK API keys are encrypted on-device and requests go directly to the provider you choose. Managed hosted-AI requests are disabled. On supported iPhones, text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food descriptions can be processed by Apple Intelligence on-device as the final fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail. Barcode lookup sends only the scanned barcode to Open Food Facts and stores the returned nutrition locally. Optional nutrient goals, Adaptive Goals preferences, Home nutrient-card choices, saved review nutrition edits, food photos from the app or iOS Share Extension, iOS Siri/App Intent food or weight phrases, cached thumbnails, widget snapshots, and Apple Watch nutrition snapshots are local preferences/data except for the specific BYOK provider or final on-device Apple Intelligence request needed to analyze a food description. AI estimation sends only the context needed for that request, such as reviewed meal + daily-total context for a meal what-if suggestion or Siri food text for Siri food logging. Apple Health / Health Connect energy-burn goals read active/total energy only after the user enables that setting. **Delete All Data** is local-only — it wipes the app's storage (food log, weight log, body-fat log, profile, Coach chat, saved meals, API keys, widget / Watch snapshot) but never touches Apple Health or Health Connect. Samples you've synced are yours; if you want them cleaned up, do it from Health / Health Connect settings. See [Privacy Policy](https://fud-ai.app/privacy.html).
